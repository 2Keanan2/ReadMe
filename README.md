# Keanan Parr
I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer from Tauranga, New Zealand. I find enjoyment in creating solutions to issues that affect the end user may face so that their use of my application is smooth and concise.

# About Me
I recently finish a 17 week intensive boot camp course through Dev Academy New Zealand. During such course, I learnt a variety of skills applicable in daily work use such as; Front/Back-end server coding, CSS, React.JS, JavaScript. With these skills I've learnt, I look forward to using them in the work I have coming up.

# Projects
A few of the projects I completed have been pinned to my homepage. One of them is my own quick works for learning Japanese. Whereas the other one called Pie-Stars is a web based app developed my me and two others from the boot camp. This project was the final product of the course and was meant to show what we had learnt and if we could impliment it all with a group and within a deadline of 7 days.
